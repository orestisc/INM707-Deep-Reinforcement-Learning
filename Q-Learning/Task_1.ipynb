    "## The grid\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid is created by division of the castle environment by starting with two borders, one horizontally and one vertically. This way the castle is divided into 4 parts. Then it randomly chooses 3 of the 4 parts to add an empty space for the agent to be able to go through. The initial plan was for our game to be a normal maze with borders left and right or up and down as the agent moves but we run into problems as we wanted to add enemys that blocked the agent from going through. Thus, we created the maze more spacious.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The game\n",

    "- The agent decides on an action to move to(up, down, left, right)\n",
    "- The action is sent to the environment and returns observations, rewards and a boolean that indicates whether the environment terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment terminates if the agent reaches the princess, it collides with the enemy or run out of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a tuple of relative coordinates between the agent and the princess(The exit).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing an action, the agent receives a reward depending on the cell it ends up on:\n",
    "- If the agent collides with a Coin, it receives a reward of 150.\n",
    "- If the agent collides with an Enemy, it receives a reward of -500 and the environment resets with the agent in the original position.\n",
    "- If the agent collides with the Princess, it receives a reward of 300 and the environment resets.\n",
    "- At each action, the agent receives a reward penalty of -1.\n",
    "- If the agent tries to go through a wall it receives a reward of -10."
