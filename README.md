# INM707-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

Q-Learning Algorithm on solving a custom stochastic Turtle maze environment.

The agent tries to find its way towards the exit. There is also an enemy which randomly moves in the maze. If the agent reaches the exit or collides with the enemy, the game resets with the agent placed in a random position.

The aim is for the agent to find the most efficient path from any position in the maze.
